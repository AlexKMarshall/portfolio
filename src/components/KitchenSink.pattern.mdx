description: All markdown and component elements available in article posts — headings, lists, code, links, figures, and tags.

This pattern shows every element you can use in a post. Use it as a visual reference for how article body content and related components render.

## Headings and text

Use **bold** and *italic* for emphasis. Clear headings (h2, h3) make posts easier to scan.

### A subsection (h3)

Short paragraphs with one main idea work best. You can also use inline `code` when referring to files or technical terms.

## Bullet lists

- One idea per paragraph
- Short lists when you have a few related points
- Headings that describe what the next block is about

## Numbered lists

1. Write the post in markdown (or MDX) under `src/content/article/`, or use a folder with `index.mdx` for colocated assets
2. Add a `title`, `pubDate`, and optional `summary` in the frontmatter
3. Save the file; the article listing and post page will pick it up automatically

## Links

Here is [a link to the articles index](/articles). Links use the same underline and hover styles everywhere.

## Blockquote

> In real posts you can use blockquotes for pull quotes or quoted material. Structure and spacing stay consistent with the rest of the body.

## Code block

Multi-line code blocks use fenced syntax with a language label. Here is a simple React component:

```tsx
function Greeting({ name }: { name: string }) {
  return <span>Hello, {name}!</span>;
}

export default Greeting;
```

## Figures (global assets)

Figures are rendered with the `<Figure id="..." />` component. Global assets live under `src/content/images/<id>/` with an image file and `meta.yaml`. In folder posts, you can also use colocated image folders; resolution is local first, then global.

### Figure with alt only (no caption)

<Figure id="figure-plain" />

### Figure with caption

<Figure id="placeholder" caption="Placeholder with a caption set in the post." />

### Figure with caption and attribution

Asset has both `caption` and `attribution` in meta (e.g. Unsplash credits).

<Figure id="curved-fabric" />

## Tags (article metadata)

On article pages, optional tags appear below the date. Same component used in the pattern library:

<ArticleTags tags={['astro', 'markdown', 'demo']} />
