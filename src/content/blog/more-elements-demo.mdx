Here’s a short intro before we get into the structure. This post is here so we can check how different markdown elements render.

## Why structure matters

Using clear headings and lists makes posts easier to scan and read. This section uses an **h2** so it stands out in the outline.

Things that help readability:

- One idea per paragraph
- Short lists when you have a few related points
- Headings that describe what the next block is about

## Lists in practice

You’ll often want bullet lists for options or steps. For example, a simple checklist might look like:

- Write the post in markdown (or MDX) under `src/content/blog/`
- Add a `title`, `pubDate`, and optional `summary` in the frontmatter
- Save the file; the blog listing and post page will pick it up automatically

Numbered lists work too, but this post sticks to bullets to keep the demo focused.

## Your own images (screenshots)

Add a folder under `src/content/images/` with your image and a `meta.json` (alt, optional caption, optional attribution). Use `<Figure id="folder-name" />` in posts; caption can be overridden with the `caption` prop.

<Figure id="placeholder" caption="Placeholder with a caption set in the post." />

## Unsplash images with attribution

Add a folder under `src/content/images/` (e.g. `curved-fabric/`) with the downloaded image and a `meta.json` that includes `alt`, optional `caption`, and `attribution` (paste the Unsplash “Copy” HTML). Example:

<Figure id="curved-fabric" />

Caption and attribution come from the asset’s `meta.json`; you can override the caption with the `caption` prop.

## Wrapping up

With headings, lists, and figures (caption + optional attribution), you can keep assets organized and credit in one place.
