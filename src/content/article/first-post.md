This is the first article. It has a few sentences so we can test both listing styles: with a frontmatter summary and without.

The second paragraph is here. On the listing page you should see either the custom summary above or these first few sentences, depending on whether `summary` is set.

More content follows for the actual post page. Semantic HTML and readable typography matter for long-form text.
