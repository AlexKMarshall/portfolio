Here’s a short intro before we get into the structure. This post is here so we can check how different markdown elements render.

## Why structure matters

Using clear headings and lists makes posts easier to scan and read. This section uses an **h2** so it stands out in the outline.

Things that help readability:

- One idea per paragraph
- Short lists when you have a few related points
- Headings that describe what the next block is about

## Lists in practice

You’ll often want bullet lists for options or steps. For example, a simple checklist might look like:

- Write the post in markdown (or MDX) under `src/content/article/`, or use a folder with `index.mdx` for colocated assets
- Add a `title`, `pubDate`, and optional `summary` in the frontmatter
- Save the file; the article listing and post page will pick it up automatically

Numbered lists work too, but this post sticks to bullets to keep the demo focused.

## Global images

Add a folder under `src/content/images/` with your image and `meta.yaml`. Use `<Figure id="folder-name" />` in any post.

<Figure id="placeholder" caption="Placeholder with a caption set in the post." />

## Local images (colocated with this post)

This post is a **folder** (`more-elements-demo/index.mdx`). The folder can contain subfolders that are image assets used only here — same structure: image file + `meta.yaml`. Reference with the same `<Figure id="screenshot" />`; resolution is local first, so this shows the colocated screenshot:

<Figure id="screenshot" caption="A screenshot that lives in this post’s folder. Move the folder to src/content/images/ to make it global." />

## Unsplash images with attribution

Add a folder under `src/content/images/` (e.g. `curved-fabric/`) with the downloaded image and `meta.yaml` (use `attribution: |` and paste the Unsplash “Copy” HTML). Example:

<Figure id="curved-fabric" />

## Wrapping up

With headings, lists, global figures, and colocated local figures, you can keep assets next to the post when they’re only used once — or move the folder to `src/content/images/` and update the id to make an image global.
