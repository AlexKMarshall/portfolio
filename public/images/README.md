# Served images (generated at build)

Images are **not** authored here. They live in **`src/content/images/`**: one folder per image, each with the image file and a `meta.yaml` (alt, optional caption, attribution). The build copies them here so they can be served (e.g. on Netlify). See `src/content/images/README.md` for the content structure.
